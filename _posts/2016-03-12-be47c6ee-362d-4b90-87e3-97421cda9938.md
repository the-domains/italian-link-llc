ITALIAN LINK GENERAL TRADING L.L.C. was formed by Mr
Andrea Spadola and Mr Hasan N. Al Zaabi following the success of their other
company ITALIAN LINK Building Materials Trading L.L.C. with the idea of
enlarging their sectors of trading to a broader spectrum of enterprise.

Since the formation of ITALIAN LINK Building Materials
Trading L.L.C. in 2010, a database of Governmental and high net worth profile
customers has been created and satisfied by performance and high quality
services and products delivery in the field of supplying natural and
semi-natural stone and marble products produced in Italy and delivered by the
Italian Link team to its clients in GCC.

The market has shown interest to receive quality
products with innovative designs and ITALIAN LINK has been able to manage to
supply them with a very competitive price.

The success of ITALIAN LINK is the possibility to
supply Made in Italy products at a very affordable price. This is the reason
why clients have been choosing to do business with Italian Link. The new
ITALIAN LINK GENERAL TRADING LLC has the ability to source and secure new and innovative
products made in Italy and to supply them to the MENA market.

The new ITALIAN LINK GENERAL TRADING LLC will carry on
supplying building materials specializing on the stone business where the team
is already very successful but also will focus on the supply of new products
such as kitchens, furniture, ceramics, but also new technologies for
construction of environmentally eco-sustainable housing, and will also will
supply consultancy services for Italian companies who want to come to do
business in the MENA regions. Moreover a section of Italian food supply will be
established due to the family business of Mr Andrea Spadola who holds a network
of 150 supermarkets in Italy and the wholesaler network to supply also the
customers in UAE.

To
understand the background and abilities of the team we will give brief
description of the existing business performance with the first company ITALIAN
LINK Building Materials Trading L.L.C.:

Formed in 2010 under the laws of the
U.A.E. in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, Italian Link Building Materials Trading
L.L.C. was created and inspired by the passion and experience of Mr Andrea
Spadola with passion and the vision of 'Linking the World to Quality'

Building on unparallel successes with
both private and governmental sectors in Europe and USA, Mr Andrea Spadola was
at the forefront of a number of successful projects in the U.A.E. including the
supply of stone for the Ministry of Interiors General Administration building
in Abu Dhabi, as well as the new Police Stations and the new Civil Defense
Buildings in the Abu Dhabi Western Region, Eastern Region and Al Ain.

Recognising their niche, Italian Link
Building Materials Trading L.L.C. was established to provide a localised and
personal service and to supply premium-quality Italian limestone and other
technologically engineered stone products to customers across the MENA region,
the GCC and other international markets.

Combining the founders twenty years of
global experience across consulting, design, manufacture, supply and
installation and being backed up by three of Italy's largest lime stone
quarries and stone manufacturers, Italian Link now partners with leading
architects and designers to offer a genuinely integrated, fine-quality solution
with the scope of deliver personalised support services from the conceptual
stages through to the implementation of each project by applying its knowledge
and experience to the architectural drawings, pleasing the aesthetic vision as
well as being technically ideal for its intended application.

With the vision and palette of the
Italian designer in mind, the Italian Link L.L.C. team provides value-added
consultancy service, helping each customer make informed decisions when
selecting the best material for each project and taking into consideration the
total cost, to meet the budget.

Powered by a team of over 100
professionals and stone specialists, Italian Link L.L.C. uses only
premium-quality material, sourced directly from Italy. As every project is
unique Italian Link L.L.C. organises and builds the team of specialised master
craftsmen at the quarries and factories across Italy, implementing a team of
Architects, Engineers and installers that will realise, study and apply the
customised specification on a 'per job' basis taking into account the
characteristics and demands of the desired work to the time frame agreed,
superseding the clients expectations and bettering the company's promises.

The Italian Link team as a group
provides core competencies such as accounting or finance, business or
management experience, industry knowledge, strategic planning experience and
customer-based experience or knowledge. The team constructively challenge and
help develop proposals on strategy, review the performance of management in
meeting agreed goals and objectives, and monitor the reporting of performance.

The company also imports marbles, tiles
and granites to satisfy the specific needs of each client maintaining its
distinct competitive edge in the market as it deals directly with top-tier stone
suppliers from Europe, Brazil and other prominent suppliers, eliminating the
need of a third party and thereby achieving significant cost savings that are
passed on to the clients.

Moreover, the company adheres to strict
environmental norms and green building specifications to provide a full range
of products and services that deliver minimal environmental impact and
complement the sustainable development initiatives being implemented across the
